#### Welcome to the Juicebox User Docs!

Juicebox is a **programmable crypto funding protocol** with very flexible parameters. You can use it as a crypto-native replacement for platforms like Kickstarter, Patreon, Gofundme, or even as an alternative to venture capital.

The protocol's fundamentals are relatively simple:

1. When people pay your project, they receive your project's tokens. Like other tokens, these can be used for governance, or for token-gated websites.
2. You can distribute funds out from your project, to the wallets or Juicebox projects of your choosing. You pre-define these distributions, but you can change them over time.
3. If people are unhappy with the direction your project is headed, they can redeem their tokens to claim a proportional share of the ETH held in the project.

As the project creator, you have powerful controls over each one of these mechanics. You can change token issuance rates, redemption rates, distributions, and other project settings over time, leading to powerful and elegant tokenomics. You can also lock your settings in place for pre-determined amounts of time, guaranteeing to your community that you won't rug them. Juicebox lets you have as much control over your project as you might want, but it also lets you give up control when you need to.
